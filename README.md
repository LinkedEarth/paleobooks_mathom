# LiPDbooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks illustrating the use of Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) in paleoclimate research. LiPDBooks gathers multiple examples of complex workflows inspired by real-world paleoclimate problems. If you have suggestions for more examples, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/LiPDbooks/issues). If you want to contribute, please [get in touch](mailto:linkedearth@gmail.com). If you want to give us a shoutout, we're [social](https://twitter.com/Linked_Earth)!


## The LiPD ecosystem

The LiPD ecosystem consists of the following digital resources:
- the LiPD data standard, described in [McKay & Emile-Geay (2016)](https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-12-1093-2016), which is [GeoCODES](https://www.earthcube.org/geocodes)-compliant. 
- The [LiPD utilities](https://nickmckay.github.io/LiPD-utilities/), a set of codes in Matlab, R and Python to interact with LiPD data.
- The LiPD [playground](http://lipd.net/playground), a user interface to get your data into LiPD.
- [GeoChronR](https://nickmckay.github.io/GeoChronR/), an R package to generate state-of-the-art age models using ensemble methods, analyze those ensembles with a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize results in an intuitive way. 
- [Pyleoclim](https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util/), a Python package with many of the same capabilities, as well as other ones. 
- the [LinkedEarth Ontology](http://linked.earth/ontology/), a formal ontology describing the LiPD data model in human- and machine-readable form. 
- the [LinkedEarth platform](http://wiki.linked.earth), which has served as community hub to develop the first [PaleoClimate Reporting Standard (PaCTS)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019PA003632).

These resources form a *research ecosystem*, increasingly interoperable with other resources, like WDS-Paleo, Neotoma, and (soon) PANGAEA. The figure below illustrates some of these connections:

## Requirements

All code is open-source, with installation instructions provided with each package. Most of the code herein uses R or Python, both freely available. If you have issues installing any of it, please get in touch. 

## License

All notebooks herein are provided under an [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license. 

## Citation
We needn't tell you that making research tools accessible requires time and effort. If you find any of these resources useful and use them in your own research, please do us the kindness of one or more citations. Each notebook in this collection is registered on Zenodo, and associated with a digital object identifier (DOI). Following the link in the top left corner of each notebook will yield appropriate textual citation. If you use any of the standards (LiPD, PaCTS) or the software (GeoChronR, Pyleoclim), please cite them as well. It will make  us (and NSF!) very happy to hear that these investments spawned more research.
